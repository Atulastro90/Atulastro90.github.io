 <h5>MY VIEWS ON INDUCTION PROGRAMÃ· </h5>
    It is a great initiative by the collage to organise an Induction Program for the newly admitted students of first year . It really gives me the life lessons and what to do or not do in the future to become a successful person and and valuable asset of the collage as well as the whole society .
